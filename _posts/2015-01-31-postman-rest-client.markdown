<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en" target="_blank">Postman</a> - powerful HTTP client and a must have tool for developers who regularly work with APIs–from designing to testing and to developers just beginning to consume APIs for web and mobile app development projects. </p>

<p>Postman with more than 60k users is one of the highest rated productive app in Google's chrome store. </p>

<p>This post is not an in-depth review rather a quick intro to the app. I hope by the end of the post you would have already be using it. Capabilities of Postman are excellent compared to any other tool available today.</p>

<p><h3>Why Postman?</h3>
It’s free (few advanced features are paid). Available as both chrome packaged app and as an extension and works on all OS that runs Chrome. No drama of setup and maintenance. Just a one click install from <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en" target="_blank">Chrome's webstore</a>.

<p><h3>Why Postman?</h3>
Intuitive interface. Simple UI-UX requires no documentation to get started ;). Easy to create API requests under 20 seconds.

<p><h3>Why Postman?</h3>
Better organization. Postman lets you organize APIs and saves them as collections. You can re-run them anytime without the drama of editing again.

</p>
<br>



<p><h3>Why Postman?</h3>
Postman let’s you set up multiple environments - like local setup, staging setup, live environment etc.. for the APIs. Environments can also be best used to separate sensitive data (like passwords/tokens) from the API calls.

</p>
<br>


<p><h3>Why Postman?</h3>
Easy to share collections and also easy to import a collection. All within 2 clicks.
